# Super Store Sales & Performance Dashboard
## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed sales, cost, and profit data to uncover key insights into business performance. The dataset required significant preprocessing before visualization, and I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to display crucial metrics.

## Data Preprocessing
Before creating the dashboard, I ensured data quality by:

 - **Cleaning the dataset** – Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant details.

- **Fixing date format issues** – Standardized date columns, which were stored as text due to mixed formats (MM-DD-YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY).

- **Creating calculated columns** – Generated new fields to enhance analysis.

- **Developing measures** – Created key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

- Average Shipping Days - Profit Margin Ratio - Total Orders & Customer Segments Analysis

## Dashboard Highlights
 - **Sales Performance:** Monthly trend analysis of Sales and Cost.

- **Orders by Shipping Mode:** Breakdown of order distribution across shipping types.

- **Sales % by Category:** Identified revenue contribution from different product categories.

- **Profit & Cost Trends:** Month-over-month comparison to assess business growth.

- **Regional Analysis:** Interactive slicers allow filtering sales performance by region.

## Key Insights
-> The average shipping time is 4 days, influencing delivery efficiency.

-> The profit margin is 11.62%, indicating a stable business model.

-> Standard shipping dominates order fulfillment, impacting logistics strategy.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI** – Data visualization, slicers, DAX measures

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Fixed inconsistent formats, handled missing values

- **Descriptive Analytics** – Identified key trends in sales and profit
